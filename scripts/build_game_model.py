# VAULT · NFL GAME MODEL  →  data/game_model.json
#
# A team power-rating model that produces a "Vault line" for each game: a
# projected spread, total, and win probability. Fit from real game scores
# (nflverse games.csv, 1999-present, which also carries the historical closing
# lines used to validate it).
#
# HONEST FRAMING (measured — see the backtest it prints):
#   The model MATCHES the market to ~0.4 pts on margin and total, but does NOT
#   beat the closing line (ATS ~49%, O/U ~49%, win-prob Brier just behind the
#   market). NFL closing lines are the sharpest forecast there is. So the Vault
#   line is shipped as a market-QUALITY *context* number — a model estimate shown
#   next to the market — NEVER as a +EV edge. Do not label it as one.
#
# MODEL (stable online ratings, updated after each game, mean-reverted each
# season):
#   margin: net rating per team; pred_margin = rate[home] − rate[away] + HFA
#   scoring: off/def points ratings; pred_total = home_pts + away_pts
#   win prob: Φ(pred_margin / sd_margin)
#
# Pure stdlib (json/math/statistics/urllib). No numpy/pandas.
#
# Usage:
#   python3 scripts/build_game_model.py            # fit + backtest + write
#   python3 scripts/build_game_model.py --dry      # fit + backtest, no write
