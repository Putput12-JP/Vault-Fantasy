#  Closes the loop prop-edge-model-plan.md calls #5. The snapshots are RETAINED
#  (finished weeks are kept, unlike the live board), so this rebuilds the whole
#  ledger deterministically each run — no append/merge, no drift.
#
#  CLV (closing-line value) is the PRIMARY signal: it accrues every week at low
#  variance, so it's the fast read on whether our number is sharp. Realized win%
#  is the slower, higher-variance confirmation. The builders read the scoreboard
#  back to sharpen the model over the season (docs/edge-feedback-loop.md).
